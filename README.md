# Machine Learning Project: re-implementation of *"Noise2Noise"* framework

## Description
This project aims to partially implement the deep learning training procedure described in "Noise2Noise: Learning Image Restoration without Clean Data" by Lehtinen *et al.* [[1]](#1).

The authors of [[1]](#1) show how it is not necessary to have high quality clean targets for succesfully training a deep learning model for the image restoration task. Actually, they report comparable (if not better) performance when using corrupted target pairs for training, eliminating the need for (often expensive) clean target acquisition.
